## 👀 What I'm Doing Right Now
- Learning the ropes of **system administration** (Linux, Windows, networking).  
- Building small **homelab projects** with Active Directory, Docker, and Pi-hole.  
- Writing **simple Bash scripts** for automation and monitoring.  
- Documenting my process so I can look back and track growth.

Here you’ll mostly find:  
- **homelab-setups** → Notes, diagrams, and experiments.

## 🌍 Why This GitHub Exists
This is not a polished portfolio (yet!) — it’s my **learning log**.  
I break things, fix them, write about it, and share what I understood.
